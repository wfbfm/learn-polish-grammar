# Bilingo - Learn Polish Grammar

You can play with Bilingo at https://wfbfm.github.io/learn-polish-grammar/

## Why use Bilingo?

To an English-speaking layperson like me, the Polish language feels fiendishly difficult to learn.

While [Duolingo](https://www.duolingo.com/) does a great job of introducing new vocabulary - I don't feel like I am getting a good grasp of the underlying
grammar rules of the language.

So, [Bilingo](https://wfbfm.github.io/learn-polish-grammar/) is a simple tool to help you practise Polish conjugations and declensions.

## Acknowledgements

I am only just beginning to learn Polish - so you wouldn't want the grammar dataset to be manually populated by me.

Instead, I sourced the backing grammar data from online materials.
